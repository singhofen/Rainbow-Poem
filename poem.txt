Hello World!

What a great tutorial, many thanks from edinburghrules :) 
newly here

Cześć !
Learning github functionalities
The Rainbow and the Unicorn and the Pony and don't forget the Singing Starfish!
hello!!!!!!!
good luck
The starfish is a smart fish
Rainbows happen following rain when the sun comes out
Today is Earth Day.

A day to smile and not to pout!
"I love Earth Day.", says Peter Pony.
"TOdaaay is 28th December 2016...!!!"
Today is Thursday. 
I enjoy macoroni
Today is raining
Yesterday was sunny skies.
"Well I love the sea," sang the stupendous starfish.
Earth Day is my favorite color.
I am thirsty.
Purple rain
purple rain
i only wanted to see you
bathing in the purple rain!
is not sullen
is not pain
this is dark, no?
is not pink
is not orange either
is not brown like a beaver
indeed sang the stupendous starfish
I went to the bar and got a fever.
I only wanted to see you bathing in the shallow tide pool
Blue is cold but also cool!
Teal
Green is calm
Eel
Maroon
Purple
Lip balm
Brown 
Indigo
Earth day is a day
And I should say:
Clouds
Unicorn
....never forget the This. this. this., this. this. this. .......
I said to myself.
Keep Calm and Carry On!
Yellow, the color of the best-known plasma sphere
Is the color of the year.
Red is hot
Hear! Hear!
East or West Dannie is the best!
These are the colors of the rainbow.
And the rainbow coloured unicorn.
Pony
unicorns have have horns and that ryhmes (no pun intended
ponys are small baby horses
Peter Pony drinks a cup of oolong tea.
It tastes wonderful.
Wonderful to me.
There must have been some cicadas on those leaves, how lucky!
And the party, the invited everyone but me
Learning with shiffman is like looking at a beautiful rainbow everyday.
Like the rainbow after storm in New York the other day.
What should I say?
Unicorns exist.
Everything else is fake news and demand a hug.
And so do you.
At the same time; in the same space?
only in Timbuktu.
After rain comes sun and in between the rainbow gets it done.
Let's dance!
The crumbling cookie!
Fun is fun!
Roses are red, violets are blue.
Purple Reign
I like you too
Poems are wonderful land for mind
so no worry about the structure
Some other time
Pat should not be forgotten
Rainbow initial coordinates are: 11.5504° N, 92.2335° E
Fairies are real!
Happy ending
I cannot feel
Hello Governor
I've never seen a rainbow in Tokyo
I play with a yo yo
Love ur vids
Pot of gold
So I'm told
Box of Lucky Charms
Cumberland farms
Pony of poets
Hamburgers dancing at the meatball!!
Brown lawns are the "New" green lawns!
Too close to home
To be or not to be a unicorn!
Ai Lad, Unicorns are marvelous!!
Running through the clouds
making dreams come true
they all hear the train
coming to challenge their brains


Party Hard!

I like rainbows in the sky
They force me to ask the question "Why,
if the world holds such pleasures,
such life affirming treasures,
must I eat that mincemeat pie?"
Ick.
I just bought a box of tissues.


MAMAAAAAAAAA OOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOHOOHHH didn't mean to make you cry...

Awesome Tutorial
Rainbows lead to gold
Understanding git is worth it's weight in gold
gold pot recieved!

I do not need drugs to be a genius;
I do not need to be genius to be human;
But I need your smile to be happy.
